At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and\nobjectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\nWriting computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem\nsolving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about\nsolutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of\nlearning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Activity\n\n1. *Why\tdo\tyou\tthink\tuderstanding\tcomputer\tprograms\tis\trelevant\tin\tour\ttime\ttoday especially\tin\tthe\tnew\tnormal?*\n\n    - Understanding how computer programs works is now a necessary skill to have now that we are having a new normal life due to the pandemic. We all know that most of the workers all around the world are now relying on the Internet to work at home so it is good for us to properly manifest and use the full potential our computers has for us to use. Moreover, as time passes by, our technology are advancing to a new level as new programs are invented and more oppurtunities will open as computer programming will become more advanced, so it is a great advantage for us to learn and understand computer programming.\n    \n    \n2. *If\tyou\twere\table\tto\tlearn\tcomputer\tprogram\twhat\tprogram\twill\tyou code?\tWhy?*\n\n    - Nowadays, there's an abundant amount of business companies that are booming up using the Internet platforms, such as Shopee and Lazada, so I think the best and convenient computer program to learn would be PHP, Java and CSS. I chose these computer programs because business companies online needed a lot of databases for their data, files, and stocks and these computer programs can make it for them. Moreover, in regards for their employees, by using these programs I can create a website and/or an application that can conveniently monitor them. Lastly, for the system inside the business companies, by the help of these computer programs, I can easily innovate and automate the system making it easier for the business owners to check and supervise his whole business.\n    \n    \n3. *What\twould\tbe\tyour\tprimary\tmotivation\tin\tlearning\tprogramming?*\n\n    - Keeping in mind that the technology that we have is gradually advancing and improving, my primary motivation is to make use of its full potential to create something convenient that can help the humanity to live easily in the near future. Learning computer programming can really be an essential skill to have since we are now living in an era where technology matters and by learning computer programming I can become a successful Electronics and Communication Engineer in the near future."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Python Programming Language"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Python is one of the High-Level languages.
